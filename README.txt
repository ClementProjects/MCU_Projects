This project is a Sine Wave Generator combined with Cloud Transfer Communication Project. It is based on STM32 MCU that generated sine wave, then through Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) converted the wave and input it back to the MCU Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) using DMA. After the sine wave signal is input back to the MCU, using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) module to undergo a fourier transform and obtained the respective sine wave fundamental and harmonic components amplitude and base frequency. The amplitudes and frequency information is then send  into ESP8266 Wifi Module using serial wire. Then using TCP-IP connection, sends the respective wave to an AliCloud Server to display for the user remotely.
